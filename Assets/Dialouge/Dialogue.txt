Hello fellow traveler!
I was just camping here in the forest when all of a sudden <color=#de1f1f>a big bee</color> took my uhhh...
MILK from me and now I cant get it back!
<color=#de1f1f>The bee ran into the deep dark part of the forest</color> and I'm too scared to run after him.
But you look brave enough to go in there and get my MILK from that stupid bee... 
Here, take this <color=#73c6fa>Shroomsword</color> and get me my MILK back!
<color=#de1f1f>Press</color> <color=#73c6fa>(left click)</color> <color=#de1f1f>if you want to attack</color>
When you have it <color=#de1f1f>come back here</color> so I can give you a reward and a clue where you should head next on your journey! 



Good work traveler getting my MILK back!
Now as promised I will give you a clue on where you should head next and <color=#73c6fa>10 coins</color>.
<color=#de1f1f>Go up by the blacksmith shop and buy whatever you like with the coins I gave you, when you are up there there's a way down where you can get to</color> <color=#73c6fa>"Grassmallow"</color> <color=#de1f1f>, but that way is the most dangerous part of the forest so be careful and watch your surroundings.</color> 
Good luck and thanks again!

Good luck on your journey!
